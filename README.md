# NetflixClone

To clone the Netflix landing page, I started by structuring the HTML to lay out the various sections such as the header, main banner, and content areas. I created a responsive grid to showcase the movie selections and used form elements for user interaction points like sign-ups.

For styling, I utilized CSS to mimic Netflix’s color scheme and typography, ensuring the clone closely resembled the original site’s aesthetic. I employed Flexbox for layout control, especially for the navigation and footer, and used media queries to maintain responsiveness across different device sizes.

I added dynamic functionality with JavaScript, such as the FAQ accordions that expand and collapse upon user interaction. I also scripted the email sign-up field to validate user input, ensuring proper email format before submission.

Throughout the process, I focused on replicating the visual and interactive elements with a keen eye for detail, making sure that the clone was a faithful representation of the Netflix user interface, solely using front-end technologies.
